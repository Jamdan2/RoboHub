# Robot Hub

A web app for representing your FRC team online.

### What is Robot Hub's Vision?

Robot Hub is under development right now, but I hope for it to be a type
of social platform for FRC teams to represent themselves, share their
ideas about games, showcase their robots, and more.

### Contributing

Robot Hub's frontend is being developed in Kotlin targeting JavaScript,
using JetBrain's React Wrappers. The advantage to using Kotlin over
JavaScript is that Kotlin provides type-safety, null safety, a 
cleaner syntax, and many other benefits. If you would like to contribute
to Robot Hub's frontend, please become familiar with these technologies.

Robot Hub's backend is written in Kotlin targeting JVM, using the Ktor
server framework, and the FireStore database. If you would like to
contribute to Robot Hub's backend, please become familiar with these 
technologies.

### License

Whichever one is the default, I haven't got to that yet.
